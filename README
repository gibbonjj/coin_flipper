textbook.  Be specific about what methods or algorithms are involved,
and what sections of the textbook are involved (if applicable): [you do
not need to list any of the code that we wrote for the assignment,

ANSWERS TO ASSIGNMENT README QUESTIONS (if applicable):

1:
No code from the internet is allowed to be used for this assignment, even if it is modified.

2:
25% two heads, 25% two tails, and 50% heads and tails.  Heads and tails is larger because of probability.  The probability of first coin is heads or tails is 1 and the probability that the second coin is not the first flip is 0.5.  1 * 0.5 = 0.5.

3:
I was getting pretty consistently precise results with 1000 runs.  Obviously the more runs made the more percise the runs will be towards 25:25:50 ratio.

4:
Maximum integer values are rouhly 4.1 billion.  I was getting the program to work with roughly 2.1 billion trials.
